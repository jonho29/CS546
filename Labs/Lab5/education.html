        <h2>Mansfield Elementary School</h2>
        <p>
          About: Mansfield Elementary is a Kindergarten through 6th grade school
          located in Mansfield, New Jersey. It was a tiny school in a rural
          town, but the teachers were great and they helped shaped me into who I
          am today.

        <p>Favorite Class: Greek Mythology</p>

          My favorite memory from Mansfield was when I hit a home run during my
          first Little League baseball game. I got lucky it went out of the
          park, because I just watched the ball soar instead of actually
          running, so I would be doomed if it landed in play.

        <h2>Warren Hills Middle School</h2>
        <p>
          About: Warren Hills Middle School is a 7th through 8th grade school
          located in Washington, New Jersey. It had four sending disctricts,
          Mansfield being one of them. Honestly, middle school overall was my
          least favorite period. The classes and teachers felt relatively boring
          and unimportant. Many activities and sports were canceled due to lack
          of funding.

          My favorite memory from middle school was when I "broke the ice" at
          the first dance. As the stereotype, all of the boys and girls were
          awkwardly standing on opposite sites of the room. My friend pushed me
          out into the middle and got the guys to cheer me on, so I danced to
          whatever middle school hit was playng with the worst, whitest moves
          possible. Everyone had a laugh and eventually joined in, probably
          because their embarassment was gone, knowing they couldn't embarass
          themselves worse than I did after that.

        <h2>Warren Hills High School</h2>
        <p>
          About: Warren Hills High School is a 9th through 12th grade school
          located in Washington, New Jersey. It had five sending districts,
          Mansfield being one of them. I really enjoyed high school, especially
          compared to middle school. There were plenty of classes to choose
          from, and many many clubs and sports teams to join. I was very
          involved back in high school, with things such as the soccer team,
          robotics team, jazz club, marching band, key club, habitat for
          humanity, and more.

          My favorite memory from high school was winning the SteelStacks music
          festival in Bethlehem, PA with my school's Jazz Band. I played the
          alto saxophone and was extremely nervous going in, as the venue was
          very professional and the other groups attending were very good. Yet,
          the band played our best, and ended up winning with our chosen three
          songs. The saxophone section also won "Best Saxophone Section," which
          was awesome. We then got to return at a later date to perform
          alongside a professional jazz band and be recorded on television!

        <h2>Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
        <p>
          Stevens Institute of Technology is a private research institution
          located in Hoboken, New Jersey. I have definitely enjoyed my time
          here, and am happy to live in a nice town with plenty of things to do.
          Being so close to New York City has shown me so many opportunities,
          and I hope to live and work there when I graduate.

        <p>Favorite Class: Web Programming</p>

          My favorite memory so far at Stevens had to be Syllabus week of
          Sophomore year. I was staying in a Stevens Leased apartment, where I
          met so many other cool people going here that lived nearby. During
          Syllabus week, naturally we had so little work, so we were able to
          just hang out with no worries in the world and party at night, and
          even headed into NYC a few times that week for the nightlife. I've
          never been so free of stress and responsibilities as I felt that week.
