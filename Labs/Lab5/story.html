        I have always really enjoyed skiing and snowboarding. When I was
        younger, I first learned to ski with my parents and sister. One year, we
        could finally afford to take a trip to the west coast, where the
        mountains are way larger and the slopes are more challenging. I was so
        excited for this trip, and considered myself a pretty decent skiier for
        my age. I was probably about 12 years old.

        Along the side of some trails are small paths through the woods. These
        are usually narrow little slopes that people carve out by going over
        them multiple times. These tend to be fun and short; they may wrap
        around some trees and seclude you for a small while, but tend to lead
        back to the main trail in a short distance. The night before our first
        day on the slopes, it had snowed at least a foot. I was so excited, as
        skiing in fresh powder is the best!
      </p>
      <p>
        I was going down a typical trail with my family that day, probably a
        blue square rating, or average difficulty. Part of the way down, I was a
        bit behind my family but noticed one of those hidden side paths through
        the trees. I saw a little jump on it and thought it would be fun, so I
        headed off. It started out fine, but the trail went deeper and deeper
        into the woods. I figured it would soon meet back up with the main
        trail, so I continued. After a while, the trail started to pick up in
        difficulty. I figured I had gone far enough and was so skilled (in my
        cocky youth) that I could handle the rest of the trail, so along I went!
        This trail was quite difficult and covered in trees down the middle. It
        was only about as wide as 2 skis could fit. You definitely could not
        ride side by side with another person on this trail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, along the trail was a steep dropoff on the left side. This was
        covered in probably 6 feet of untouched powdery snow from the weather
        and isolation. As I continued on the trail, a tree snuck up on me, so I
        had to swerve left, and clipped the tree and ended up tumbling down the
        side of the cliff. I was completely buried in powder far past my head
        and my skis came off. I eventually got a hold of my surroundings and
        stood face up, poking my head through the powder. Now, if you have worn
        ski boots, you know how uncomfortable and difficult to walk in they are.
        They are composed almost completely of stiff plastic that clips into the
        ski bindings. I continuously tried to walk up the side of the cliff, but
        it was too steep and slippery. There was no way to ascend it in ski
        boots, and I had nothing to grab onto to pull myself out.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I did all I could, and waited. It must have been close to an hour
        before another skiier came by. I desperately screamed to get his
        attention, and he looked at me like I was an idiot (I was). Through
        trial and error, he was able to extend one of his poles down to me,
        which I could grab on to. I slowly but surely climbed out of the pit and
        was completely covered in snow. I thanked him and then had to take the
        walk of shame back to the main trail. I decided not to go further and
        walked backwards along the path until I would get back to where I
        started. Along the way, I saw quite a few people, who looked upon me
        like the loser I was. If only I had managed to see someone in shorter
        than an hour when I was trapped! Instead, they all show up afterwards to
        witness my failure. I eventually made it back to the main trail, and
        tumbled my way down to the lift.
