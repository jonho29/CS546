        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Justin Westley. I'm currently a junior studying Computer
          Engineering here at Stevens Institute of Technology. I'm from
          Hackettstown, New Jersey. I'm 21 years old and looking to pursue a
          career in Software Engineering. I lived there up until college with my
          parents, sister, and grandma. Now, I live in an off-campus apartment
          with some friends I met sophomore year.

          I first got into Computer Science in high school. I'm from a small
          town and my parents aren't in STEM, so I had no idea what computer
          science was for a long time. My sophomore year, my high school offered
          an Intro to Computer Science course, which I didn't take because I had
          no idea what it was. Later that year, there was a STEM showcase, were
          alumni who worked professionally came back and discussed their
          experiences. So many former students came back and described what
          computer science was and what they did for a living, and it
          immediately caught my interest. Next year, I took the Intro to CS
          course, and I've been hooked ever since.
